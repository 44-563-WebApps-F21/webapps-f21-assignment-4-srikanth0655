                Drawing-Room at the Manor House, Woolton. There are people having some conversation.
            </h6>
            
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
shame left.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="stage-direction">[After a pause.]</p> <p>They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
cough?</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">But I haven’t got a cough.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">They’re looking at us. What effrontery!</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">They’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">Let us preserve a dignified silence.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">Certainly. It’s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by
Algernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">A most distasteful one.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">But we will not be the first to speak.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech"> Certainly not.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends
on your reply.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
guardian’s brother?</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name algernon">ALGERNON.</h4>
<p class="speech">In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.</p>
<br>
<h4>CECILY.</h4>
<p class="stage-direction">[To Gwendolen.]</p> <p>That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
it not?</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes, dear, if you can believe him.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name cecily">CECILY.</h4>
<p class="speech">I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="name gwendolen">GWENDOLEN.</h4>
<p class="speech">True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital
thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for
pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an
opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?</p>
